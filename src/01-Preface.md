# Preface

For over a decade, I have been basically killing my time, paying little attention to the class, and leaving homework undone whenever possible. This is because a school is never a place for learning knowledge and it can only deprive me of sleep. I have never attached enough importance to grades or entering a higher school. Now I have only one way to enter a university in China mainland, which is purely getting enough grades in the National College Entrance Examination. 90% is barely enough to enter a average university, and I think 95% is sufficient for me.

Occupied with doing research on NCEE, I basically stopped learning, researching and creating other things.
