# Maximum number of coplanar atoms

The only case where all atoms are not coplanar is saturated carbon atoms.
A saturated carbon atom is a carbon atom that has only single bonds between other atoms.

**Algorithm**
1. Locate saturated carbon atoms
2. Cut out 2 bonds in the principle of maximizing the number of atoms remaining

**Exercise** How many maximum number of atoms are coplanar in
