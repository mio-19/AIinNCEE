# Magnetic Field

## Procedure: Forces between two currents

> Two wires carrying current in the same direction attract each other, and they repel if the currents are opposite in direction.

## Procedure: Test Electric Current

Used to analyze the strength of the magnetic field generated by multiple currents.

1. Imagine that there is a current at the coordinates to be analyzed
1. Calculate the resultant force
1. Use Left-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field; \\( F \propto B \propto I \\)

> \\( F_x = q(E_x + v_y B_z - v_z B_y ) \\)

For NCEE:

\\( q l_x B = \Sigma q v_x B t = m \Delta v_y \\)

\\( q l_y B = \Sigma q v_y B t = m \Delta v_x \\)
