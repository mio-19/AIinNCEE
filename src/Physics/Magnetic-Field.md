## Algorithm: Forces between two currents

> Two wires carrying current in the same direction attract each other, and they repel if the currents are opposite in direction.

## Algorithm: Equivalent Electric Current

Used to analyze the strength of the magnetic field generated by multiple currents.

1. Imagine that there is a current at the coordinates to be analyzed
1. Calculate the resultant force
1. Use Left-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field
