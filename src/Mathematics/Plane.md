# On A Plane ...

## Line

General Form: \\( A x + B y + C = 0 \\)
Form 1: \\( y = k x + b \\)

### Theorem 1

\\( A x + B y + C \\) have the same sign \\( \iff \\) Points are on the same side

\\( A x + B y + C \\) have the different sign \\( \iff \\) Points are on the different side

### Theorem 2

If the range of angles is continuous

90 degree is in the range and it is not the endpoint \\( \iff \\) the range of slope is discontinuous

90 degree is in the range \\( \iff \\) there is \\( \infty \\) in the expression of the range of slope
