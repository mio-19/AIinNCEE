# Foreword

Gross domestic product, Engel's coefficient, Wealth, Grades in education. Products, students, lifespan, air, virus, cities and some societies are compared with some accurate figures. Widespread use of figures employs a succession of gamesmanship and people devoted to it, referred to as machines. To appreciate getting grades as an intellectual activity in its own right you must turn to examination-oriented learning; you must read and firmly remember and use rules, facts and some models, and finally forget them after a short period of time. It doesn't matter much whether they are true or what applications they serve. What does matter is how well you brain perform just like a database or a machine running machine learning algorithms and how smoothly you fit with other people in the creation of a great civilization. The learner must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of collection.
